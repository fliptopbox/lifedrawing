# SVG EXCLUSION:

To exclude an SVG file from being served to the client, prefix the file name with a non-alpha character.

for example: ~Sketch080.svg

# SVG CANVAS SIZE
Its important to remember that the SVG canvas should match the extent of the illustration, and exclude unused white space, this alows us to managed the positioning of the illustration client side.
